# Early Detection of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Using MRI Analysis

## Project Overview
This project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify MRI scans into stages of Alzheimerâ€™s disease: **non-demented**, **very mild dementia**, **mild dementia**, and **moderate dementia**. The project focuses on improving early detection by addressing borderline cases through advanced image preprocessing and deep learning techniques.

## Results

### Key Findings
- **2D CNN**: Initial high accuracy (>99%) due to data leakage was resolved by treating 61 related slices as a 3D scan, revealing true complexity.
- **3D CNN**: Achieved strong performance in binary classification (demented vs. non-demented) with balanced datasets.
- **Transfer Learning**: Highlighted challenges due to preprocessing differences and dataset variability.

### Metrics
- **Precision, Recall, F1 Score**: Evaluated classification performance, especially for mild and very mild dementia.
- **Confusion Matrices**: Analyzed misclassification patterns to identify areas for improvement.

## How to Run
1. **Train Models**:  
   - For 2D: Run `AD-Detection-CNN.ipynb`.  
   - For 3D: Run `3D-AD-Detection-CNN.ipynb`.  
2. **Evaluate Performance**:  
   Use `test_on_diff_dataset.ipynb` to measure generalizability on the Kaggle dataset.
3. **Fine-Tune Models**:  
   Run `transfer_learning.ipynb` to adapt OASIS-trained models to new data.
